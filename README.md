# PDF Merger
 A Golang PDF FIle merger

A simple PDF file merger, i needed to send a bunch of pdf files in a email, decided to as practice make a pdf file merger to make it easier.

go run main.go output.pdf input1.pdf input2.pdf.....

I have also included the built go program just ./pdfmerger, i may end up making a UI
